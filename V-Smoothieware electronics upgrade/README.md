This is the firmware config as it stands now. The things that aren't working yet are the BL-Touch sensor, and that the bed heating turns off once it reaches the desired temperature.

The board I am using is this one: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/BIGTREETECH-SKR-V1-1-Control-Board-32-Bit-with-ARM-CPU-32bit-Control-Board-Open-Source/32962443179.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.27424c4dkYZSkC

Any help would be greatly appreciated. If you want to contact me directly, my email is info@datulab.tech

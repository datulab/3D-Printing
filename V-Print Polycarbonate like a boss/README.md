This is my Polycarbonate profile for Slic3r PE. Just load it as a print settings profile. 
You will have to create a new custom material yourself, as every brand of PC needs a different temp. 
For me 290C on the nozzle with the max bed heat (120C) worked fine. 
Parts with a large surface are might still warp, an enclosure can help, but you might have to experiment a bit.
